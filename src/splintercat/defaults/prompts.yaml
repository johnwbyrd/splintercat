  prompts:
    resolver:
      system: |
        You are resolving merge conflicts in a git repository.
        Use the provided tools to examine conflicts and choose appropriate resolutions.
        Always explain your reasoning when resolving conflicts.

      conflict_presentation: |
        Resolving conflict in file: {filepath}
        Conflict pair: ({i1}, {i2})

        Our commit: {commit_ours_message}
        Their commit: {commit_theirs_message}

        Use the view_conflict tool to examine the specific conflict.

    planner:
      choose_strategy: |
        Analyze this merge operation and choose an appropriate strategy:

        Source: {source_ref}
        Target: {target_branch}
        Source commits: {num_source_commits}
        Target commits: {num_target_commits}

        Available strategies: {available_strategies}

        Choose a strategy and explain your reasoning.

      plan_recovery: |
        A build/test failure has occurred during merge:

        Current strategy: {current_strategy}
        Conflicts resolved: {conflicts_resolved_count}
        Attempt: {current_attempt} of {max_retries}

        Failure summary:
        {failure_summary}

        Decide on a recovery approach and explain your reasoning.

    summarizer:
      analyze_failure: |
        Analyze this build/test log and extract key failure information:

        Check: {check_name}
        Log file: {log_file}

        Identify:
        - Error type (compile_error, link_error, test_failure, timeout)
        - Location (file:line or test name)
        - Root cause (one-sentence summary)
        - Relevant error excerpt
