# Instructions for LLMs

## Development Environment

- IMPORTANT: If you need to run a command-line tool, use the mcp-cli-exec MCP tool instead of the built-in tool.  The mcp-cli-exec tool is much more stable and dependable.

- **Virtual environment** - Python tools are in `../.venv/bin/` - you may need to source `../.venv/bin/activate` before running ruff, python, pip, etc. If you need some new Python package, update pyproject.toml .

- **Install in editable mode:**

```bash
source ../.venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

- **Running tests:**

```bash
source ../.venv/bin/activate
pytest                    # All tests
pytest tests/test_checkrunner.py -v  # Just CheckRunner
ruff check                # Linting
```

## Git Repository Structure

The llvm-mos repository has multiple remotes for testing:

- **upstream/main** - llvm-mos official branch (READ ONLY - never modify)
- **heaven/main** - llvm official repository (READ ONLY - never modify)
- **stable-test** - Test branch, should be deleted and recreated from upstream/main for each test run

## Code Style

- **SCREW BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY** - Do NOT engineer for backwards compatibility.  BREAK AND REWRITE CODE TOTALLY FROM SCRATCH IF NEEDED, using a superior design and structure.  There are NO existing users.  Doing something "for backward compatibility" is an antifeature.

- **NO EMOJIS** - Do not use emojis anywhere in code, comments, docstrings, commit messages, or markdown files
- Use ruff - Run ruff check after major changes and make sure to clean up any problems

- **WRITE THE LEAST AMOUNT OF CODE POSSIBLE** - Much of the functionality we need already exists in Pydantic or other python libraries.  USE THEM.  Do not reinvent the wheel.

## Documentation Style

- **NO CODE in Markdown** - Do not put Python code blocks in design documents or any markdown files
- **Markdown is for prose** - Design documents contain descriptions and explanations only
- **Function interfaces OK** - Brief interface specifications are acceptable (methods, parameters, return types)
- **Keep it concise** - Describe what components do, not how they're implemented

## Examples

**Good - Function Interface:**
```
Source ABC:
- get_patches() â†’ PatchSet
```

**Bad - Full Code:**
```python
class Source(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def get_patches(self) -> PatchSet:
        """Fetch patches from the source."""
        raise NotImplementedError
```

**Good - Prose Description:**
"Strategy is a pure function that analyzes State and returns the next PatchSet to try, or None when done."

**Bad - Code Example:**
"Here's how SequentialStrategy works: [50 lines of Python code]"

## Implementation Timing

- **DO NOT implement until needed** - Wait for real-world merge cases that simpler tools cannot handle
- **DESIGN.md is source of truth** - Architecture is designed and documented in doc/DESIGN.md
- **Configuration-driven** - Settings belong in config.yaml, not hardcoded in Python
- **Prove it works first** - Build MVP, test on real data, learn from failures

## Summary

- Code belongs in `.py` files
- Markdown belongs in `.md` files
- Keep them separate
- No emojis anywhere
- No code blocks in markdown
- Don't implement until we encounter problems that require the solution
